-- Query 9 Bruce and Diana are looking very suspicious. They both withdrew money from the Leggett Street ATM
-- and were caught on security footage leaving the bakery.

-- Raymond overheard the theif saying they got on the first flight out of Fiftyville the following day.

SELECT * FROM flights
WHERE month = 7
AND day = 29
AND origin_airport_id IN (

-- This shows that flight 36 is the first flight leaving Fiftyville the day after the crime

-- Query 10 See if any passengers of flight 36 appear on suspects list

SELECT name
FROM suspects JOIN passengers
ON suspects.passport_number = passengers.passport_number
WHERE flight_id = 36;

-- This shows that Bruce, Taylor, and Kenney were all on the first flight out of fiftyville the next day
-- Since Bruce was also seen leaving the Bakery and withdrawing money,
-- He is likely the theif

-- Query 11 Find the accomplish by seeing who Bruce called. I can see he called (375) 555-8161, so I'll
-- just check who that number belongs to

SELECT name
FROM people
WHERE phone_number = '(375) 555-8161';

-- It looks like Bruce's accomplice is Robin

-- Query 12, Find out what city Bruce escaped to. I already know the flight id is 36
SELECT city
FROM airports
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT destination_airport_id
    FROM flights

);

-- So Bruce escaped to New York City, and his accomplice is Robin
