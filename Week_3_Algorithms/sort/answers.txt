sort1 uses: Bubble sort
    real    0m0.219s for 10,000 random
    real    0m0.090s for 10,000 sorted items
    real    0m0.305s for 10,000 reversed items
How do you know?: Bubble sort can be very fast when the items are in the right order.
since the time for sorted items was so short, this must be bubble sort.

sort2 uses: Merge sort
    real    0m0.069s for 10,000 random items
    real    0m0.073s for 10,000 sorted items
    real    0m0.072s for 10,000 reversed items
How do you know?: It's much faster than all the other algorithms

sort3 uses: Selection sort
    real    0m0.158s for 10,000 random items
    real    0m0.141s fpr 10,000 sorted items
    real    0m0.192s for 10,000 reversed items
    
How do you know?: The 3 times were very similar, but not as fast as Merge sort.
